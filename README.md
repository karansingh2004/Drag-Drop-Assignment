# Drag-Drop-Assignment
Hello Fellow Developer,You can save the above code as an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the drag and drop functionality with the two containers. The first container contains three draggable items, and you can drag and drop them into the second container. The success message will be displayed when an item is successfully dropped into the second container. Clicking the reset button will clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.
